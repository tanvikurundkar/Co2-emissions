# Co2 emissions
The objective of this project is to use python to help process statistics about CO2 and present information using data visualization. We used libraries like matplotlib, seaborn for visualization and pandas, numpy, etc., for data analysis. This project will help the user understand more about trends in carbon emissions across the globe and use them to make a difference for the future.

## Data Preprocessing
We have replaced the Null values with the average value of each column using the ".mean" function so that we do not receive inaccurate results. Moreover, we have considered years only after 1990 since the years before contain more null values which would adversely affect our results.


We analyzed the data using visualizations and answered questions like:
 - 'Which country had the highest CO2 emissions and in which year ?'
 - How does the population and GDP of a country affect its CO2 emissions?
 - What are the drivers of emissions in a country?
 - What is the trend of the world's co2 emissions from 1990 to 2019 per decade?
